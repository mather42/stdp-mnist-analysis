# STDP Energy Analysis

Biologically-inspired STDP network for MNIST classification with energy efficiency analysis.


## Current Issues

- Most neurons biased to class 0 
- High lateral inhibition (17.0) may be blocking learning
- Spike activity higher than expected (energy paradox)

## Usage

Run the main notebook:
jupyter notebook stdp_analysis.ipynb

## Requirements

brian2, torch, numpy, matplotlib
